#The Queue

The Queue is a system to inspire people to stay in school, and attain their educational goals. This is done by paying people with a Bitcoin like crypto-currency called Chips that can be used to pay for the various online educational platforms that offer certification from some of the top tier schools in the world, and even college credit in some cases, through MOOC platforms.

It’ll allow you to keep track and manage your progress, with a personalized Curriculum Vitae (CV), as well as connect with a global community of people wanting to share in the learning experience.

**Aspects**

The three main aspects of the system are
+ Determining your learning goals by creating your queue
+ Interacting with the market of educational platforms with Chips
+ Showing off your CV after every certificate and course completion

**Benefits**

Anyone person who’s ever wanted to advance their skills for a career, or continuing educational goals, or general life-long learners, especially if they don’t have the means take out college loans and/or be able to pay for tuition.

All that’s needed is your determination, and access to the Internet.
